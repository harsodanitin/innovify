This code is designed to be run in Google's App Engine. MIT runs a
public instance that all are welcome to use to build App Inventor
Applications. You do not need to compile or use this code if you wish
to build MIT App Inventor applications.

We provide this code for reference and for experienced people who wish
to operate their own App Inventor instance and/or contribute to the project.

This code is tested and known to work with Java 8.
